# WeatherAppProject
This is an app that uses JSON data from the Yahoo Weather Service to show the weather.  It also uses images that illustrate how the weather is at a certain time.  I have updated the original "proto" version to allow users to enter a location via EditText, and with the push of a button search for the weather for that location.
